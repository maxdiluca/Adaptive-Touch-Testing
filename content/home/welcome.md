Clinical testing of touch typically involves manual application of test stimuli. The Sensory Motor Neuroscience (SyMoN) Lab and Obi Robotics are developing an automated approach based on continuously varying stimulus intensity or frequency for assessing touch discrimination ability. Discrimination difficulty is adjusted adaptively up or down to yield 75% correct performance.
