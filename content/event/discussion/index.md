summary: ''
abstract: 'Many behavioural tests, especially those concerned with touch and
sensory motor function involve manual administration. This raises issues
about test sensitivity and bias. It is also labour intensive requiring
trained testers and can make it difficult to compare results across
separate sessions with different testers. The purpose of this discussion
group is to review progress being made to develop automated adaptive
testing procedures for cognitive and behavioural assessment and consider
the extent to which they afford remote testing.'
